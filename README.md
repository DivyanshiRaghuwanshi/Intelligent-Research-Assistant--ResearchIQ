# ResearchIQ - Intelligent Research Assistant

ResearchIQ is a Streamlit-based assistant built for the NeoStats AI Engineer use case. It combines document Q&A (RAG) with live web search and supports Groq, OpenAI, and Gemini in one interface.

Live Demo: https://intelligent-research-assistant--researchiq-mj5nt7la2xgpwmurt5r.streamlit.app/

## Why this project

Most assistants are good at either static knowledge or current events, not both. This project solves that gap by letting users query uploaded files and the web from the same chat session, with clear control over how responses are generated.

## Features

### 1. Document Q&A with RAG

- Upload PDF, TXT, and DOCX files
- Split documents into chunks with overlap for context continuity
- Create embeddings locally using all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Store vectors in FAISS and retrieve top relevant chunks
- Generate grounded answers from retrieved chunks with source references

### 2. Live Web Search

- Uses Serper API for real-time web results
- Returns cleanly formatted sources and snippets
- Handles timeout and API errors with readable fallback messages

### 3. Concise and Detailed response modes

- Concise mode for quick, direct replies
- Detailed mode for structured, expanded answers
- Switch instantly from the sidebar

### 4. Search mode is user controlled

This is an important behavior in this project:

- Users explicitly choose which tools are available through sidebar toggles
- Document Search (RAG) can be enabled or disabled
- Web Search can be enabled or disabled
- The agent can only use tools that the user has enabled

So, tool access is under user control. The agent decides how to answer only within those selected limits.

### 5. Multi-provider LLM support

- Groq: llama-3.1-8b-instant
- OpenAI: gpt-4o-mini
- Gemini: gemini-2.5-flash

Default provider in the current codebase: Gemini.

### 6. Session memory and context trimming

- Uses MemorySaver with per-session thread_id
- Keeps context manageable by trimming to recent messages
- Supports long conversations without unbounded prompt growth

## How it works

1. User sends a query
2. App builds the toolset based on sidebar toggles
3. If RAG is enabled, the agent can call get_answer
4. If Web Search is enabled, the agent can call search_web
5. Retrieved evidence is synthesized into final user-facing output

- Serper API key for web search

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd project
```

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows (Command Prompt)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API keys

Create a .env file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
```

Do not commit keys to GitHub.

### 5. Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8501.

## Using the app

1. Select provider from the sidebar
2. Select response mode (Concise or Detailed)
3. Choose search tools with toggles
4. Upload documents if you want RAG-backed answers
5. Ask questions in chat

## Example prompts

- Summarize this document in 5 bullet points.
- What does this report say about risk factors?
- Give me the latest updates on multimodal agents.
- Compare what my document says with recent web findings.

## Configuration reference

Main settings live in config/config.py:

- DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER
- RETRIEVAL_TEMPERATURE
- RESPONSE_TEMPERATURE
- EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME
- CHUNK_SIZE
- CHUNK_OVERLAP
- TOP_K
- MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES
- SERPER_NUM_RESULTS

## Streamlit Cloud deployment

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Create a new app on Streamlit Cloud
3. Set app entrypoint to app.py
4. Configure environment variables/secrets in deployment settings
5. Deploy and validate both RAG and web search flows

## Security notes

- Never commit API keys
- Keep .env and secrets files out of version control
- Rotate keys if they are accidentally exposed

## Troubleshooting

### Imports not resolved in editor

Select the project virtual environment interpreter in VS Code.

### No module named ...

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Web search not working

Confirm SERPER_API_KEY is set and valid.

### Gemini/OpenAI/Groq call failures

Check selected provider key, model access, and quota limits.

### Port already in use

Run Streamlit on another port:

```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8521
```

## Using the App

1. **Select LLM Provider** from the sidebar (OpenAI is default and recommended).
2. **Choose Response Mode** — Concise for quick answers, Detailed for structured explanations.
3. **Search Mode** — Both RAG and web search are enabled by default. Uncheck either to restrict the agent to one source.
4. **Upload Documents** — Drag your PDFs, Word files, or text files into the upload box. You'll see a chunk count confirming the index was built.
5. **Start chatting** — Ask anything. The agent will pick the right tool automatically.

### Example Queries

**With documents uploaded:**
- "Summarize this document"
- "What projects are mentioned in the resume?"
- "Explain the Self-Supervised Methodology section in detail"
- "What are the key findings in chapter 3?"

**Web search:**
- "Latest developments in LLM agent frameworks"
- "What is the current state of RAG in production?"
- "Recent AI research on vector databases"

**Hybrid (both tools):**
- "What does the document say about transformers, and what are the latest improvements to that architecture?"

## Deployment on Streamlit Cloud

### Step 1 — Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2 — Deploy

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click **New app**
3. Connect your GitHub account and select the repository
4. Set **Main file path** to `app.py`
5. Click **Advanced settings** and open the **Secrets** tab
6. Paste your API keys in TOML format:

```toml
GROQ_API_KEY    = "your_groq_key"
OPENAI_API_KEY  = "your_openai_key"
GEMINI_API_KEY  = "your_gemini_key"
SERPER_API_KEY  = "your_serper_key"
```

7. Click **Deploy**

Streamlit Cloud will install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and start the app. The HuggingFace model downloads automatically on first boot.

## Design Decisions

**Why LangGraph instead of a basic LangChain agent?**
LangGraph's `create_react_agent` with `MemorySaver` gives proper checkpoint-based memory tied to a `thread_id`. This means each user session is truly isolated — even in a shared deployment, two users won't see each other's conversation history. A basic LangChain agent with a message list doesn't give you this.

**Why local embeddings instead of OpenAI embeddings?**
`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` runs entirely on CPU with no API calls. This means document indexing is free regardless of file size, and there's no network dependency during the embedding step. For a demo and case study submission, this is the right call. A production deployment targeting scale would switch to a hosted embedding service.

**Why FAISS over a cloud vector database?**
FAISS is in-memory and has zero infrastructure overhead. For a single-session demo, it's perfectly appropriate. The architecture is modular enough that swapping FAISS for Pinecone or Weaviate would only require changing `rag_utils.py` — the rest of the system doesn't care.

**Why two separate LLM instances at different temperatures?**
Covered in the architecture section above. Short version: temperature=0 for fact extraction from documents, temperature=0.3 for conversational responses. Mixing these would compromise one or the other.

## Security Notes

- API keys are loaded from `.streamlit/secrets.toml` locally and from Streamlit Cloud Secrets in production
- `secrets.toml` is in `.gitignore` and will never appear in the repository
- No API keys are displayed anywhere in the UI
- User-uploaded documents are processed in memory and are not persisted to disk between sessions

---

## Troubleshooting

**App won't start / import errors**
Make sure you're running from inside the `project/` folder and your virtual environment is activated.
```bash
cd project
streamlit run app.py
```

**"No module named X" error**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Groq XML tool-call error** (`tool_use_failed`)
This is a known issue with certain Groq llama models generating `<function=...>` format instead of JSON. Switch to OpenAI from the sidebar or use `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (most stable Groq option).

**Gemini quota errors**
Free-tier Gemini API keys from Google AI Studio may have zero quota on newer models. This requires a Google Cloud project with billing enabled. OpenAI or Groq are the recommended alternatives.

**Document upload shows 0 chunks**
The uploaded PDF may be image-based (scanned) rather than text-based. Text-based PDFs have extractable content. Image-based PDFs require OCR which is not included in this version.

**Port already in use**
Another Streamlit instance is running. Kill it first:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
Get-Process python | Stop-Process -Force
streamlit run app.py
```
